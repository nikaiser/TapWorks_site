### Background
Working out of Greentown Labs, my friend Erik and I put our heads together and we came up with a simple IoT solution for his subscription service cold brew business. From the original idea of keg monitoring to the final implementation, the TapWorks team built the product on a tight schedule, low budget, and with a key mindset of reliability in mind.
